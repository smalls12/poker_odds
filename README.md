# poker_odds
Should rename this

The goal is to provide a library that can be used by a front end GUI.
This library started by trying to produce the odds of a player winning a typical game of texas hold 'em poker.
The library has since been gradually expanding on being a full fledged back end to support a game itself.

## To Do
1. Actually produce a library for consumption

## Potential Stuff
1. Wrap the library with python bindings
   Leads into 2
2. Create an HTTP Server for interfacing with the library
   This would allow a Web GUI to be created
